## Reflection 1
In this tutorial, I have applied the coding standards such as:
* Using efficient variable naming
* Using functions to reduce repetitive codes
* Using proper and consistent indentation throughout the code

Eventhough theres not much problem in going through this tutorial, I still take a lot of time to get comfortable with the newly learned Java Springboot framework. 
There are probably still some minor problem with the usage of the framework. To improve this, I probably need some more time to adjust my self with the framework system. 
I also need to learn more about the MVC system used in the Java Springboot because it is a new system for me compared to the MVT.

## Reflection 2
1. After finished writing the unit test, I feel saver and more confident about my code. The unit test gave me a sense of reasurrance about my code correctness.
   In my opinion, the amount of unit tests to be made in a single class is relative to the amount of function inside the class. More functions needs more tests to check the correctness.
   The unit tests for our code also needs to meet certain expectations to be able to verify our program. Those expectations revolves around checking value correctness, function return value, etc. Its not only about getting a success in the test result.
   From the previous statements, I have a conclusion that 100% code coverage doesn't mean that the code have no bugs or errors.
2. Making a new Java class with the same setup procedures and instance variables genarally reduces the overall quality of the code. This is because it creates multiple codes with the same objectives.
   This approach could possibly result in some issues involving difficult development proccess due to similar or duplicate codes. It would be better to make include the new class into the old one with better segmentation.
   With that, we can reduce the duplication of code and make a cleaner and tidier development environment.
